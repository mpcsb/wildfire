Summary
Best available perimeters for all known wildland fires in the United States. This data set is an ongoing project and as such, may be incomplete.

This data set is part of an ongoing project to consolidate interagency fire perimeter data. Currently only certified perimeters and new perimeters captured starting in 2021 are included. 
A process for loading additional perimeters is being evaluated.



The Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Group provides authoritative geospatial data products under the interagency Wildland Fire Data Program. Hosted in the National Interagency Fire Center ArcGIS Online Organization (The NIFC Org), WFIGS provides both internal and public facing data, accessible in a variety of formats.

This service includes perimeters for wildland fire incidents that meet the following criteria:
Categorized in the IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information) integration service as a Wildfire (WF) or Prescribed Fire (RX)
Is Valid and not "quarantined" in IRWIN due to potential conflicts with other records
Attribution of the source polygon is set to a Feature Access of Public, a Feature Status of Approved, and an Is Visible setting of Yes
Perimeters are not available for every incident. This data set is an ongoing project with the end goal of providing a national interagency fire history feature service of best-available perimeters.

No "fall-off" rules are applied to this service. 
The date range for this service will extend from present day back indefinitely. Data prior to 2021 will be incomplete and incorporated as an ongoing project.

Criteria were determined by an NWCG Geospatial Subcommittee task group. 

Data are refreshed every 5 minutes. Changes in the perimeter source may take up to 15 minutes to display.
Perimeters are pulled from multiple sources with rules in place to ensure the most current or most authoritative shape is used.

Warning: Please refrain from repeatedly querying the service using a relative date range. This includes using the “(not) in the last” operators in a Web Map filter and any reference to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. This type of query puts undue load on the service and may render it temporarily unavailable.

The authority for producing the Organizational Assessment lies with the incident commander (NWCG PMS-210), thus, the Organizational Assessment can change independent of the published decision.
